"""I Had $50,000 Saved and Was Still Broke - Here's Why Traditional Saving Advice is Wrong""","""Confession: I thought I was financially responsible with $50K in savings. Turns out I was just hoarding money out of fear.

The wake-up call came when I realized my 'emergency fund' had become a 'dream killer fund.' While my money sat earning 0.5% interest, inflation was eating it alive and I was missing every investment opportunity.

Here's what I learned about the difference between saving and wealth building:

**Broke mindset:** Save money ‚Üí feel secure ‚Üí repeat **Wealth mindset:** Save money ‚Üí give it a job ‚Üí watch it multiply

Same $50K, completely different outcomes. One person stays broke despite saving, another builds wealth with the exact same amount.

The question that changed everything: 'What is this money's PURPOSE?'

Emergency fund? Yes, but only 3-6 months expenses. Everything else needs to be WORKING - index funds, real estate, skills development, business investment.

Anyone else had this realization Your money is waiting for instructions.""",46,1749739048.0

Please leave Binance for your own safety. It finally happened to me,"After over 4 years using the platform without issue, I transferred some funds from another exchange to Binance in USDC on the 1st of the month and they wrongfully got put on hold because my transfer supposedly triggered security concerns despite it being my 10000s transfer, from the same address, to the same Binance address.

Binance then asked me to complete a deposit application retrieval if I ever want to see my money back. Which I did.

Instead of just releasing the funds, 4 days after completing the application, I got told that they will supposedly initiate a transfer of the original amount, to an address of my choice. And that it can take up to +30 days. 30 days !? Is that a joke ? Or a stalling tactic to make the customer just give up on his funds ?

No clear answer on why it might take so long, no clear answer on why my transfer got put on hold despite it not being my first transfer. 

Customer support is a joke, they have 0 training, 0 access to any information, 0 power to do anything except send their pre written robotic messages and their emojis.

crypto‚Äôs biggest heartbreaks aren‚Äôt scams or rug pulls  
they‚Äôre the ‚Äúwhat ifs‚Äù  
the moments you¬†*played it safe*¬†and still feel like you lost

he didn‚Äôt do anything wrong  
he made a smart move  
he secured real money  
it paid off bills, took care of things  
but in this space‚Ä¶  
holding wins  
and taking profit sometimes just leaves you with the itch

in the last few months it‚Äôs gotten worse

he keeps seeing the new ATHs

BTC and UK CGT,"Firstly I should clarify I‚Äôm asking for a friend as I lost all my BTC years ago in a boating accident üòâ

Said friend bought some BTC years ago when it was in single digits now it is up around $110k so to keep things simple let‚Äôs call that $100k+ profit per coin

As my friend is a high rate tax payer in the UK I think they are liable to pay 24% CGT when they sell. 

Now the interesting bit, my friend thinks he knows when the market will crash and wants to sell high and buy back when it crashes, therefore, gaining extra BTC in the process. But I think to actually make money they would need the drop to be over 24% which is a big gamble 

If the BTC is sold for $110k that‚Äôs $100k profit $24k goes to the tax man leaving home his $86k (10k + 76K after CGT) to buy back in when it drops. Is that right?

Mathematically correct way of tracking your average buy?,"Hi everyone  
  
Forgive me if this is a really simple thing and I'm over-complicating things, but I wanted to get your thoughts on how everyone tracks their average buy?

Let‚Äôs imagine the following scenario for simplicity:

Bitcoin price - $110,000

Budget - $110,000

0,4% Trading Fees on Spot Trade = $440

Total Funds actually buying BTC - $109,560

Total BTC Purchased : 0.9960000

Is your average buy $110,000 (as this is the spot price), or is it actually $110,441.77?

I would always use the 2^(nd) price as this is the total spent divided by how much BTC you receive, but I‚Äôm just sound checking this is right?

Data breach at Bitfinex?,"Hi all,

I received a phishingmail to a ""unique"" mailadress only used by Bitfinex.

Was there a known data breach?  
I asked support and they tried to ""calm me down"" - while not answering my question...

I will change my data and security tokens - but it still would be good to either have a official information - or perhaps other users.

Mail was received in the beginning of Mai. Just found it now while ""checking spam"".

CAGR and safe withdrawal rate,"I'm interested in peoples thoughts around bitcoin's future CAGR from this point, and what people think a safe annual withdrawal rate is in relation to this. 

for context - the 10 year Cagr is at 84% - on one hand it seems a stretch using this for the next 10 years, on the other we are entering unchartered territory, and I believe the average Joe doesn't realise just how deep wall streets pockets actually are. 

  
i also think the ETF's will bring more stability, and the fund managers will use derivatives to manage the price, anwe will just grind higher for longer. Get ready for boredom! 

  
FYI - i'm siding with a conservative CAGR of 20% over the next 10 years, and if withdrawals are neccessary, will look to withdraw a max of half the CAGR at 10% per annum. thanks all. ",14,1749631962.0

I‚Äôm in the selling random stuff phase - stack those sats!,"This year my knowledge and understanding around Bitcoin has accelerated massively with the help of ChatGPT. I‚Äôve just been trying to learn everything I can about Bitcoin and have gone through a little journey.

Been DCAing since the 2017 high and moved to cold storage in 2022. But lately I‚Äôve definitely taken the orange pill and unplugged from the matrix. 

I‚Äôm done with the trying to help people see the light phase. It‚Äôs a shame but a realisation I think a lot go through. Now I just want to stack sats as much as I can as quickly as I can!

Another paper wallet scam,"Hi fellow bitcoiners. I have gifted 0.01 and 0.02 btc to friends on a [bitcoinpaperwallet.com](http://bitcoinpaperwallet.com) in 2019, i reminded it to one of the friends and she got all excited about it. She of course wants to cash out. We're supposed to meet on Friday and I'm supposed to help her. 

Now upon checking the wallets the 0.01 is still there but the 0.02 is gone - and thats the friend that I'm meeting. I spent the whole day yesterday reading how the website was a scam, its such a shame. 

Anyway, i now have to inform her that BTC has been stolen and i find it hard to make the phone call. The messengers of bad news get killed unfortunately :)) Also, being kinda-sorta BTC expert in friend circles, I feel its my responsibility too that she lost that bitcoin.

  
She did mention that at some point she tried to claim it but failed. Can it be that somehow she actually leaked the private key herself? Since the other friends 0.01 BTC is still there! ( Swept it yesterday)

I wasn't sure how is it possible that all the inputs are from different wallets, and it seems that bitcoin wallets have functionality of uploading many private keys all at once and doing one transaction from many different wallets. Is this a pattern of people that got scammed with paper wallets, or is there a chance she leaked her key?

I blew 3 BTC over 6 months,"So I had a client who paid me for consulting services in BTC and I could have left it completely untouched. Here‚Äôs some pictorial proof attached

But I had some events come up and felt I just needed some extra cash and I blew through the BTC. Weeks later BTC went from $50K ish to $90K and now at $110K. The 3BTC would be $330K+

Feels like the things I got as at the $64K price point suddenly became more expensive compared to how much I paid for it and it sucks.

Idk when next I‚Äôll be paid in such a valuable currency but then it‚Äôs one of those lessons. I feel like the dude who paid 10K BTC for pizza at this moment.

Funny how I literally saw it go from $5K to $110K over the last couple years but I managed to stupidly throw away 3 whole BTC that fell in my lap on a platter of gold. I just felt like I needed to vent because everyday that passes by makes me feel sick to my stomach that I threw such a golden opportunity away for something that‚Äôs not as valuable but we live and learn

Don‚Äôt be like me folks ",561,1749622303.0

They would rather sit it out forever and miss out because their egos won't allow them to admit they were wrong.


But the markets are measurable. They are the only real-world test of any theory.


The market has clearly spoken and created a massive demand for Bitcoin. Wealth is flowing to Bitcoin. The thesis has been validated for 15 years. They are ignoring the most clear market signal in the history of mankind.

Your registerd wallet accounts with those apps will still be there with those companies; you won‚Äôt have to restore your wallet or go thru the process of registering again.  Maybe just keep one hot wallet on the phone with a little in it as a decoy. OR, get two mobile devices with your phone carrier. Keep the phone with all your wallets and big stash in a safety deposit box at a bank. And have a hot wallet with little crypto in it on the phone you carry around for daily use. ",0,1749604859.0
