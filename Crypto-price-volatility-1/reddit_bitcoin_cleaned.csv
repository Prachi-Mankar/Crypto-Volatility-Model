"""I Had $50,000 Saved and Was Still Broke - Here's Why Traditional Saving Advice is Wrong""","""Confession: I thought I was financially responsible with $50K in savings. Turns out I was just hoarding money out of fear.

The wake-up call came when I realized my 'emergency fund' had become a 'dream killer fund.' While my money sat earning 0.5% interest, inflation was eating it alive and I was missing every investment opportunity.

Here's what I learned about the difference between saving and wealth building:

**Broke mindset:** Save money → feel secure → repeat **Wealth mindset:** Save money → give it a job → watch it multiply

Same $50K, completely different outcomes. One person stays broke despite saving, another builds wealth with the exact same amount.

The question that changed everything: 'What is this money's PURPOSE?'

Emergency fund? Yes, but only 3-6 months expenses. Everything else needs to be WORKING - index funds, real estate, skills development, business investment.

Anyone else had this realization Your money is waiting for instructions.""",46,1749739048.0,confession i thought i was financially responsible with 50k in savings turns out i was just hoarding money out of fear the wakeup call came when i realized my emergency fund had become a dream killer fund while my money sat earning 05 interest inflation was eating it alive and i was missing every investment opportunity heres what i learned about the difference between saving and wealth building broke mindset save money feel secure repeat wealth mindset save money give it a job watch it multiply same 50k completely different outcomes one person stays broke despite saving another builds wealth with the exact same amount the question that changed everything what is this moneys purpose emergency fund yes but only 36 months expenses everything else needs to be working index funds real estate skills development business investment anyone else had this realization your money is waiting for instructions
Satoshi would be unable to recognise what bitcoin has become,"Instead of decentralised exchanges reigning supreme, most of the buying and selling occurs on centralised, extremely aggressive in their fees and merely profit driven therefore very expensive, government-collaborating (removing anonymity) and abusive af exchanges (e.g. hundreds of reports only on this sub about accounts being arbitrarily frozen and without resolution for months if not years etc). 

Are few multi billion dollar companies ruining the very concept of bitcoin just like few nasty corporations ruined Internet itself?

Then billionaires and institutions being the main buyers. No one using Bitconi to buy pizza or anything for that matter. Satoshi would have been appalled.

BitMinter… I had one and forgot about it.  Huh,"Hey… so, I was that weird guy who modded his PS3 to mine for coins back in high school (pre-2012).

Chances of recovering the old wallet/BitMinter account assets? ‘Bout to turn on my modded PS3 and see what I can do. Thoughts?

Cash, if any will go to my brother and a new fraud/coin/asset attorney - he had about sub-1M (USD) in coins stolen from a wallet scam (early 2024). Kid’s health is going to shit. He hired an attorney (13k) and made reports to the SS & FBI, was told he might get something recovered in 12-36 months.  He seems to have traced the wallet and assets better than the SS & FBI atm.

Please leave Binance for your own safety. It finally happened to me,"After over 4 years using the platform without issue, I transferred some funds from another exchange to Binance in USDC on the 1st of the month and they wrongfully got put on hold because my transfer supposedly triggered security concerns despite it being my 10000s transfer, from the same address, to the same Binance address.

Binance then asked me to complete a deposit application retrieval if I ever want to see my money back. Which I did.

Instead of just releasing the funds, 4 days after completing the application, I got told that they will supposedly initiate a transfer of the original amount, to an address of my choice. And that it can take up to +30 days. 30 days !? Is that a joke ? Or a stalling tactic to make the customer just give up on his funds ?

No clear answer on why it might take so long, no clear answer on why my transfer got put on hold despite it not being my first transfer. 

Customer support is a joke, they have 0 training, 0 access to any information, 0 power to do anything except send their pre written robotic messages and their emojis.

It’s been 10 days now and I have no hope of seeing my funds because all I’ve met so far are stalling tactics from Binance, to keep my funds. Application is stuck on “processing”.

My dad sold his Bitcoin in 2017 and still can’t forgive himself,"my dad sold a few bitcoin back in 2017

he had been holding them for a couple years before that .... bought early, mostly out of curiosity, just one of those quiet early believers, got in through forums, watched some Andreas Antonopoulos vids, followed a few blogs, nobody around him really “got it” back then  
but he stuck with it

then the 2017 bull run happened  
btc hit \~$15k and he cashed out

made a few ten thousand dollars..enough to feel like he won  
and back then, he did. for a guy who didn’t come from money, it was big  
he was proud, used to tell people he “knew about bitcoin before everyone else”  
told me how important it was to take profits when the market gives you a gift

fast forward a few years  
and man...

the regret hits him hard now

not every day but in those quiet moments ,,, when he’s alone at the dining table or looking at a retirement ad on TV...he’ll just say it out loud  
“if i held those coins… i could’ve retired by now”  
and then it’s silence

and i don’t blame him. we’re not talking one or two btc  
he had *enough,* enough that if he’d just done nothing and held on  
he’d be living on a beach or farmland or wherever he wanted

but that’s the thing about this space  
crypto’s biggest heartbreaks aren’t scams or rug pulls  
they’re the “what ifs”  
the moments you *played it safe* and still feel like you lost

and the worst part?  
he didn’t do anything wrong  
he made a smart move  
he secured real money  
it paid off bills, took care of things  
but in this space…  
holding wins  
and taking profit sometimes just leaves you with the itch

in the last few months it’s gotten worse  
especially with all the price talk again  
he keeps seeing the new ATHs  
the news  
the ETFs  
billionaires calling it digital gold  
and i can feel it ,,, that slow burn in him  
like he’s replaying every decision in his head again and again

i hate that for him  
he’s a good man  
and he *did win* ... just not in the way people flex now

**Edit:**  
After I shared this, a lot of people told me their own version of this story.  
Some said they regret selling early.  
Some said they regret *never* selling.  
A few even said they regret paying taxes on profits they never really felt.

This space is wild like that.

Imagine each country creating its own version of Bitcoin with a fixed supply of 21 million coins:

* **USCOIN** 🇺🇸
* **CHCOIN** 🇨🇳
* **INCOIN** 🇮🇳 ...and so on.

They could design their networks to mimic Bitcoin’s fundamentals (capped supply, proof of work or stake, public ledger, etc.), but with clean distribution from day one.

So what’s stopping them?

BTC and UK CGT,"Firstly I should clarify I’m asking for a friend as I lost all my BTC years ago in a boating accident 😉

Said friend bought some BTC years ago when it was in single digits now it is up around $110k so to keep things simple let’s call that $100k+ profit per coin

As my friend is a high rate tax payer in the UK I think they are liable to pay 24% CGT when they sell. 

Now the interesting bit, my friend thinks he knows when the market will crash and wants to sell high and buy back when it crashes, therefore, gaining extra BTC in the process. But I think to actually make money they would need the drop to be over 24% which is a big gamble 

If the BTC is sold for $110k that’s $100k profit $24k goes to the tax man leaving home his $86k (10k + 76K after CGT) to buy back in when it drops. Is that right?

If so how will he ever make money as it rarely drops that much in one go",0,1749656977.0,firstly i should clarify im asking for a friend as i lost all my btc years ago in a boating accident said friend bought some btc years ago when it was in single digits now it is up around 110k so to keep things simple lets call that 100k profit per coin as my friend is a high rate tax payer in the uk i think they are liable to pay 24 cgt when they sell now the interesting bit my friend thinks he knows when the market will crash and wants to sell high and buy back when it crashes therefore gaining extra btc in the process but i think to actually make money they would need the drop to be over 24 which is a big gamble if the btc is sold for 110k thats 100k profit 24k goes to the tax man leaving home his 86k 10k 76k after cgt to buy back in when it drops is that right if so how will he ever make money as it rarely drops that much in one go

Mathematically correct way of tracking your average buy?,"Hi everyone  
  
Forgive me if this is a really simple thing and I'm over-complicating things, but I wanted to get your thoughts on how everyone tracks their average buy?

Let’s imagine the following scenario for simplicity:

Bitcoin price - $110,000

Budget - $110,000

0,4% Trading Fees on Spot Trade = $440

Total Funds actually buying BTC - $109,560

Total BTC Purchased : 0.9960000

Is your average buy $110,000 (as this is the spot price), or is it actually $110,441.77?

I would always use the 2^(nd) price as this is the total spent divided by how much BTC you receive, but I’m just sound checking this is right?

Another paper wallet scam,"Hi fellow bitcoiners. I have gifted 0.01 and 0.02 btc to friends on a [bitcoinpaperwallet.com](http://bitcoinpaperwallet.com) in 2019, i reminded it to one of the friends and she got all excited about it. She of course wants to cash out. We're supposed to meet on Friday and I'm supposed to help her. 

Now upon checking the wallets the 0.01 is still there but the 0.02 is gone - and thats the friend that I'm meeting. I spent the whole day yesterday reading how the website was a scam, its such a shame. 

Anyway, i now have to inform her that BTC has been stolen and i find it hard to make the phone call. The messengers of bad news get killed unfortunately :)) Also, being kinda-sorta BTC expert in friend circles, I feel its my responsibility too that she lost that bitcoin.

  
She did mention that at some point she tried to claim it but failed. Can it be that somehow she actually leaked the private key herself? Since the other friends 0.01 BTC is still there! ( Swept it yesterday)

I wasn't sure how is it possible that all the inputs are from different wallets, and it seems that bitcoin wallets have functionality of uploading many private keys all at once and doing one transaction from many different wallets. Is this a pattern of people that got scammed with paper wallets, or is there a chance she leaked her key?
