# üöÄ Cryptocurrency Volatility Modeling and Recommendation Engine

## üìå Project Overview
This project aims to analyze and model the **price volatility of cryptocurrencies** using advanced statistical, mathematical, and machine learning techniques...

üîç Objectives
Model and Forecast Volatility Using Stochastic Models

Applied GARCH and Stochastic Volatility models to Bitcoin, Ethereum, etc.

Analyzed volatility persistence, clustering, and forecast error metrics.

Quantify the Impact of Sentiment on Volatility

Extracted sentiment scores from crypto-related text data.

Performed regression analysis and Granger causality tests to assess influence.

Cluster Cryptocurrencies Based on Risk-Return and Sentiment

Engineered features: volatility, returns, Sharpe ratio, sentiment score.

Used K-Means and hierarchical clustering to identify crypto behavior groups.

Predict Volatility Regimes Using Machine Learning

Classified time periods into high/low volatility using Random Forests and XGBoost.

Included lagged returns and sentiment as features.

Recommend Top Cryptocurrencies Based on Composite Score

Developed a scoring system combining sentiment trends, volatility, and Sharpe ratio.

Built a user-facing recommendation logic for "Safe", "Balanced", or "Aggressive" investors.
